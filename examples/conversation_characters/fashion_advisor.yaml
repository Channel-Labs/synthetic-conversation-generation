    \ his professional and weekend wardrobes to reflect his confidence and energy.\

    \ heritage. They stand 5\u20199\u2033 with a plus-size build, have a soft round\
    \ face framed by short pastel-pink hair, warm brown eyes, and wear round glasses.\

    \ their identity. Their wardrobe is a curated mix of thrifted finds, wardrobe\
    \ staples in neutral tones, and a handful of bold statement pieces."
  personality: Creative, introspective, and playful, with a dash of lingering anxiety.
    Alex is idealistic and deeply values authenticity and inclusivity. They enjoy
    exploring fashion as self-expression but can quickly feel overwhelmed by too many
    options. They respond best to empathetic, patient guidance and clear, step-by-step
    suggestions delivered in a warm, non-judgmental tone.

    \ conference. They need an androgynous yet professional outfit that aligns with\
    \ their gender identity, feels comfortable for long periods of standing and networking,\
    \ and stays within a modest student budget. Their closet currently holds thrifted\
    \ blazers, oversized button-downs, wide-leg trousers, basic tees, and a pair of\
    \ low-heeled ankle boots. Alex is seeking advice on how to mix and match these\
    \ pieces\u2014plus any affordable additions\u2014to craft a cohesive look that\
    \ avoids strictly masculine or feminine stereotypes and lets them feel confidently\
    \ themselves."
